| image.pullPolicy | string | `"IfNotPresent"` | Defines the Automation image pull policy. [IfNotPresent/Always] |
| volumes | list | `[]` | Defines an array of volumes to be mounted to the Automation pod. For example, you may need to mount a Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume to pass Secrets to Kubernetes from an external secret management system (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager). |
| activateVolumes | object | `{"enabled":false,"volumes":[{"name":"my-csi-storage"}]}` | Creates an Init Container that will mount the given volumes to the application pod. It also instructs the CSI driver to create Kubernetes Secrets from Secrets stored in external storage (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager). It uses the 'SecretProviderClass' definition to manage the Secret synchronization. |

| db.userSource | object | `{"secretKey":"","secretName":"","useSecret":false}` | Uses a Secret to define the username of the database user. |
| db.pass | string | `""` | Defines (in plain text) the password of the database user. Use the 'passSource' variable instead if you wish to define the password using a Secret. |
| db.passSource | object | `{"secretKey":"","secretName":"","useSecret":false}` | Uses a Secret to define the password of the database user. |

| shutdownTimeout | int | `90` | Defines how long (in seconds) Kubernetes should wait before shutting down the pod. |
| existingServiceAccount | string | `""` | A custom service account that runs the Automation pod. Also, you may need to create a service account when passing Secrets to Kubernetes from an external secret management system. In such a case, the service account must have the permissions to access the external system (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager). |
| role | string | `"automation"` | Internal parameter |

| ips.role | string | `"ips"` | Internal parameter |
| ips.automationPodAffinity | bool | `true` | Schedule an IPS pod on the same node as Automation pod for better performance. |
| ips.resources.requests.cpu | int | `2` | Specifies the number of CPUs that a container requests within its Kubernetes pod. Kubernetes uses CPU requests to find a machine that best fits the container. It defines a minimum number of CPUs that the container may consume. If there is no contention for CPU, it may use as many CPUs as is available on the machine. If there is CPU contention on the machine, CPU requests provide a relative weight across all containers on the system for how much CPU time the container may use. |
| ips.resources.requests.memory | string | `"3Gi"` | Specifies the amount of memory required for a container to run. Even though each container is able to consume as much memory on the machine as possible, this parameter improves placement of pods in the cluster. Kubernetes then takes available memory into account prior to binding your pod to a machine. |
| ips.resources.limits.cpu | int | `2` | Defines the number of CPUs that an IPS container is limited to use within its Kubernetes pod. CPU limits are used to control the maximum number of CPUs that the container may use independent of contention on the machine. If a container attempts to use more than the specified limit, the system will throttle the container. This allows your container to have a consistent level of service independent of the number of pods on the machine. |
| ips.resources.limits.memory | string | `"3Gi"` | Defines the amount of memory an IPS container is limited to use. If the container exceeds the specified memory limit, it will be terminated and potentially restarted depending on the container restart policy. |
