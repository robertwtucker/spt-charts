| resources.requests.cpu                   | int | `2` | Specifies the number of CPUs that an Interactive container requests within its Kubernetes pod. Kubernetes uses CPU requests to find a machine that best fits the container. -- It defines a minimum number of CPUs that the container may consume. If there is no contention for CPU, it may use as many CPUs as is available on the machine. -- If there is CPU contention on the machine, CPU requests provide a relative weight across all containers on the system for how much CPU time the container may use.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| resources.requests.memory                | string | `"3Gi"` | Specifies the amount of memory required for an Interactive container to run. Even though each container is able to consume as much memory on the machine as possible, this parameter improves placement of pods in the cluster. Kubernetes then takes available memory into account prior to binding your pod to a machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| resources.limits.cpu                     | int | `2` | Defines the number of CPUs that an Interactive container is limited to use within its Kubernetes pod. CPU limits are used to control the maximum number of CPUs that the container may use independent of contention on the machine. If a container attempts to use more than the specified limit, the system will throttle the container. This allows your container to have a consistent level of service independent of the number of pods on the machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| resources.limits.memory                  | string | `"3Gi"` | Defines the amount of memory an Interactive container is limited to use. If the container exceeds the specified memory limit, it will be terminated and potentially restarted depending on the container restart policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

It is set to 'true' by default for security reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ingress.tls.secretName                   | string | `nil` | The functionality of the 'secretName' parameter differs based on how you intend to provide a Kubernetes secret that stores the required certificate: -- 1) If you create a Kubernetes TLS secret that stores the required certificate manually by yourself, enter the name of the secret in the 'secretName' parameter. --    To learn about Kubernetes TLS secrets, see Kubernetes documentation at https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets. -- 2) If you intend to use the 'clusterIssuer' parameter to provide the required certificate, use the 'secretName' parameter to define a custom name for a secret that will be created by the cluster issuer. |
| ingress.tls.clusterIssuer                | string | `nil` | Allows you to defines the name of a cluster-issuer to be used for creating the certificate secret. -- For more information about cluster issuer setup, see one of the following documentations based on which platform you use to deploy Inspire: -- AKS (Application Gateway Kubernetes Ingress): https://azure.github.io/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/how-tos/lets-encrypt/#certificate-issuance-with-letsencryptorg -- EKS (NGINX Ingress): https://cert-manager.io/docs/tutorials/acme/ingress/                                                                                                                                                                             |
