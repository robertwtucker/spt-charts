Scenario 1: IPS.requests 1CPU, Scaler.requests 1CPU:  If IPS reaches 100% of its utilization capacity but Scaler is under no load, the average percentage is 50% -> not scaling. Scenario 2: IPS.requests 2CPU, Scaler.requests 1CPU:  If IPS reaches 100% of its utilization capacity but Scaler is under no load, the average percentage is 66% -> scaling. Scanerio 3: IPS.requests 1CPU, Scaler.request 1CPU, Scaler.limit 3CPU  If Scaler reaches 100% of its utilization capacity, the average percentage is 150%. If not specified, at least one custom metric must be created. |

Kubernetes converts each defined key into a secret. Use number 1 for the value of the first key's id. When switching keys, always increase the number used for the key id relative to the previous key. The id must be higher for each new encryption key. Otherwise, the encryption fails. For more information, see the 'Custom Password Encryption Keys' section of the Deployment Configuration Guide. |
| customEncryption.keys[0].keySource | object | `{"secretKey":"","secretName":"","useSecret":false}` | All encryption keys must come from the same secret. The secret must only contain encryption keys because all keys are mounted into the pod. If the secret contained any other keys (e.g. a database password), it would also be used as an encryption key. |

| resources.requests.cpu | int | `2` | Specifies the number of CPUs that a container requests within its Kubernetes pod. Kubernetes uses CPU requests to find a machine that best fits the container. It defines a minimum number of CPUs that the container may consume. If there is no contention for CPU, it may use as many CPUs as is available on the machine. If there is CPU contention on the machine, CPU requests provide a relative weight across all containers on the system for how much CPU time the container may use. |
| resources.requests.memory | string | `"3Gi"` | Specifies the amount of memory required for a container to run. Even though each container is able to consume as much memory on the machine as possible, this parameter improves placement of pods in the cluster. Kubernetes then takes available memory into account prior to binding your pod to a machine. |
| resources.limits.cpu | int | `2` | Defines the number of CPUs that a Scaler container is limited to use within its Kubernetes pod. CPU limits are used to control the maximum number of CPUs that the container may use independent of contention on the machine. If a container attempts to use more than the specified limit, the system will throttle the container. This allows your container to have a consistent level of service independent of the number of pods on the machine. |
| resources.limits.memory | string | `"3Gi"` | Defines the amount of memory a Scaler container is limited to use. If the container exceeds the specified memory limit, it will be terminated and potentially restarted depending on the container restart policy. |
| metricsAPI.enabled | bool | `true` | Since the 15.0 version, the following feature enables/disables Scaler's Metrics API endpoint. It is useful as a resource for monitoring tools which can be used to scale an Inspire Scaler cluster based on custom metrics. When performing an initial installation, this feature is applicable to both cluster and stateless architecture. However, when upgrading Scaler to new versions, the value can only be changed for stateless architecture. In cluster, you can enable/disable the endpoint using the 'Metrics API' check box in Scaler's Administration. |
| customEnvs | object | `{}` | Allows you to specify custom environment variables for the Scaler container. |
| service.annotations | object | `{}` | Provide any additional annotations which may be required. |
| service.type | string | `"ClusterIP"` | Defines the value for the service Kubernetes object. It is recommended to keep the default value because it makes Scaler accessible only from within the Kubernetes cluster. The LoadBalancer value makes Scaler accessible from the Internet. This should only be used for testing purposes. [ClusterIP/LoadBalancer] |
| ingress.enabled | bool | `false` | Enables Ingress, a Kubernetes API object that provides load balancing. |
| ingress.annotations | object | `{}` | Additional annotations for the Ingress resource. e.g: annotations:   appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-path-prefix: "/"   appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/cookie-based-affinity: "true" |
| ingress.className | string | `nil` | Name of the IngressClass cluster resource to use. e.g: azure/application-gateway |
| ingress.host | string | `nil` | Defines the Ingress host. |
| ingress.path | string | `nil` | A path mapping that corresponds to the ICM backend. If left blank, the path defaults to `/scaler/*`. |
| ingress.tls.enabled | bool | `true` | Enables HTTPS for Scaler. It is set to 'true' by default for security reasons. |
| ingress.tls.secretName | string | `nil` | The functionality of the 'secretName' parameter differs based on how you intend to provide a Kubernetes secret that stores the required certificate: 1) If you create a Kubernetes TLS secret that stores the required certificate manually by yourself, enter the name of the secret in the 'secretName' parameter.    To learn about Kubernetes TLS secrets, see Kubernetes documentation at https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets. 2) If you intend to use the 'clusterIssuer' parameter to provide the required certificate, use the 'secretName' parameter to define a custom name for a secret that will be created by the cluster issuer. |
| ingress.tls.clusterIssuer | string | `nil` | Allows you to define the name of a cluster-issuer to be used for creating the certificate secret. For more information about cluster issuer setup, see one of the following documentations based on which platform you use to deploy Inspire: AKS (Application Gateway Kubernetes Ingress): https://azure.github.io/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/how-tos/lets-encrypt/#certificate-issuance-with-letsencryptorg EKS (NGINX Ingress): https://cert-manager.io/docs/tutorials/acme/ingress/ |
| deployment.annotations | object | `{}` | Provides the ability to customize Scaler's deployment using Kubernetes annotations. |
